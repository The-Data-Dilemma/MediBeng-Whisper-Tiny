# MediBeng Whisper Tiny: Code-Switched Bengali-English Speech Translation for Clinical Settings

## Overview

For many **genAI solutions** in the **clinical domain**, doctor-patient transcription is a key task. It becomes especially difficult in clinical settings when the language is **code-switched**, meaning multiple languages are mixed during conversation. This is common in multilingual environments, particularly in healthcare.

To address this challenge, we fine-tuned the Whisper Tiny model to **translate** **code-switched Bengali and English speech** into one language, making it easier for tasks like analysis, record-keeping, or integrating with other AI models. After fine-tuning, we obtained the  [MediBeng Whisper Tiny](https://huggingface.co/pr0mila-gh0sh/MediBeng-Whisper-Tiny) model. 


The dataset, [MediBeng](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pr0mila-gh0sh/MediBeng), has been created using **synthetic data generation** to simulate code-switched conversations, allowing for more robust training of the model. This dataset was used in the fine-tuning process.

This solution is designed to transcribe and **translate** **code-switched Bengali-English** conversations **into English** in clinical settings, helping practitioners process the information more effectively and use it for patient records or decision-making. We achieved great results after fine-tuning the model.



## Model Key Features

- **Base model**: openai/whisper-tiny
- **Fine-tuned for**: Translation task (code-mixed Bengali-English ‚Üí English)
- **Domain**: Clinical/Medical
- **Language support**: Code-mixed Bengali-English (input), English (output)
- **Fine-tuning approach**: A very simple and easy-to-use fine-tuning script has been created to simplify the fine-tuning process for the translation task, ensuring efficient model adaptation.
- **Open-source**: Both the model and the dataset (**MediBeng**) are open-source, and the entire process, including fine-tuning, is available for public use and contribution.

üìÇ **Dataset**: Check out the **MediBeng** (20% subset) dataset used to fine-tune this model! This dataset includes synthetic code-switched clinical conversations in Bengali and English. It is designed to help train models for tasks like **speech recognition (ASR)**, **text-to-speech (TTS)**, and **machine translation**, focusing on bilingual code-switching in healthcare settings.

- **Training Loss**: The training loss decreases consistently, indicating the model is learning well.
- **Eval Loss**: The evaluation loss decreases significantly, showing that the model is generalizing well to unseen data.
- **Eval WER**: The Word Error Rate (WER) decreases over the epochs, indicating the model is getting better at transcribing code-switched Bengali-English speech.

## The Fine-Tune Process is Below üõ†Ô∏è

### Clone the Repository

Open a terminal on your machine and use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pr0mila/MediBeng-Whisper-Tiny.git
cd MediBeng-Whisper-Tiny
```


### Setup Instructions

#### Create a Conda Environment and Install Required Packages

To set up the environment, you can use one of the following commands:

```bash
conda create --name med-whisper-tiny python=3.9
conda activate med-whisper-tiny
```
Run the following command to install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or, install the packages
```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets librosa evaluate soundfile tensorboard jiwer accelerate
```
### Configuration Setup

The configuration parameters for the model, dataset, and repository are defined in the `config/config.py` file. For translated transcription, make sure to update the `LANGUAGE` and `TASK` variables as follows:

```python
MODEL_NAME = "openai/whisper-tiny"
LANGUAGE = "English"
TASK = "translate"
```
### Data Loading

The dataset is loaded and stored in the `data` folder, which is created by running the data processing code in the `data_loader.py` file. For training and testing, **20%** of the data from the dataset is used for both training and testing. This configuration is defined and controlled in the `data_loader.py` file.

### Training and Upload Model

A simple script has been created to easily run the fine-tuning for the translation task. To start training the model, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
#### Uploading the Model to Hugging Face

After setting up your Hugging Face token, follow these steps to upload your model to Hugging Face:

1. Set your Hugging Face token as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export HF_TOKEN="your_hugging_face_token"
   ```
   Replace "your_hugging_face_token" with the actual token value.
2. Set the `OUTPUT_DIR` and `REPO_ID` in your `config/config.py` file:

  - `OUTPUT_DIR`: Directory where your model is saved.
  - `REPO_ID`: Your Hugging Face repository ID (the name of the repository where the model will be uploaded).
  
  Example:
  
  ```python
  OUTPUT_DIR = "path/to/your/model"
  REPO_ID = "your_huggingface_repo_id"
  ```
3. Run the following command to upload your model to Hugging Face:

```bash
python upload_model/upload_model.py
```
The model testing script is available in the `tests` directory.




### Limitations
- **Accents**: The model may struggle with very strong regional accents or non-native speakers of Bengali and English.
- **Specialized Terms**: The model may not perform well with highly specialized medical terms or out-of-domain speech.
- **Multilingual Support**: While the model is designed for Bengali and English, other languages are not supported.

### Known Issue in Current Release

- Evaluation currently uses Word Error Rate (WER) during training.  
- WER is not ideal for translation tasks.  
- Future updates will include BLEU, METEOR, or chrF++ metrics for more accurate evaluation.

### Ethical Considerations
- **Biases**: The training data may contain biases based on the demographics of the speakers, such as gender, age, and accent.
- **Misuse**: Like any ASR system, this model could be misused to create fake transcripts of audio recordings, potentially leading to privacy and security concerns.
- **Fairness**: Ensure the model is used in contexts where fairness and ethical considerations are taken into account, particularly in clinical environments.
### Blog Post

I‚Äôve written a detailed blog post on Medium about **MediBeng Whisper-Tiny** and how it translates code-switched Bengali-English speech in healthcare. In this post, I discuss the dataset creation, model fine-tuning, and how this can improve healthcare transcription.
